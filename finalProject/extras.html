ISSUES:

1. Index.html - Footer vs banner: footer isn't long enough and you can see the white background.
2. Analytics.html - centering each container
3. Analytics.html - adding more datasets for each country.
4. Anaylytics.html - relationships chart - change colours and is the data being represented correctly?
5. AMCD - Look at colours on charts
6. AMCD - questionnaire - change input colours and err0r messages.

EXTRAS if there is time:

- -Instead of <br> use margin.
- Marketing page: change one to be white like in GaggleMail.

- Should I have an option for you to input the wedding date and for a countdown timer to appear?
- Create thicker bottom radius to the buttons.

- Question 5: does not appear like JS graphic on site. --> TBC with PA --> Alternative: month/date/year (3 different selectors)
