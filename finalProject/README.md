# DroppingAnchor

This website is the result of having organized many weddings for friends and siblings over a ten-year period. We always felt that the resources out there for couples were irrepressibly gendered in layout and were not sufficiently data-driven. We hope this site can be helpful for others about to anchor down or helping those to do so. Through this website we will help you organize your guests and keep track of your budget as you embark on...DroppingAnchor.
