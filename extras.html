EXTRAS if there is time:

- -Instead of <br> use margin.
- Marketing page: change one to be white like in GaggleMail.

- Should I have an option for you to input the wedding date and for a countdown timer to appear?
- Create thicker bottom radius to the buttons.

- Question 5: does not appear like JS graphic on site. --> TBC with PA --> Alternative: month/date/year (3 different selectors)
